This readme file accompanies the zipped source code for the DeviceNet
Weather Station as presented in Circuit Cellar INK.  The entire source
code is contained in two files:  devnet.cpp and devnet.h.

The zip file also includes the source for the PAL used on the DeviceNet
Interface Board. The design file for the PAL is in text format, and should
compile with just about any PLD compiler.  I used Palasm IV, which
is now public domain, and can be downladed from the AMD website.

The zip files also includes two schematics.  They are in Adobe Acrobat
PDF format and may be viewed and printed using Adobe Acrobat Reader. 

Files:
   DEVNET.CPP     Source code for the DeviceNet Weather Station
   DEVNET.H       Header file for above        
   DEVNET.PRJ     Borland C Project file
   DEVNET.MAK     Make file
   DEVNET.MAP     Map file generated by the linker
   DEVNET.PDS     Source for PAL on DeviceNet Interface Board
   DNET_BRD.PDF   Schematic for PC/104 DeviceNet Interface Board
   WSTN_BRD.PDF   Schematic for PC/104 Weather Station Board


Compiler Used:
   Borland C++ Version 3.1
   Large memory model, no optimization

Target system:
   Micro/sys (www.embeddedsys.com) model number SBC1386EX
   This board is a 25MHz 386EX, PC/104 form factor. The program
   should run as well in any reasonable DOS environment.

The DeviceNet interface implements two connections:  Explicit
and I/O Poll. The Explicit connection is capable of sending and
receiving fragmented messages.  The I/O Poll connection sends
3 bytes of data: Device status, temperature, and humidity

The DeviceNet interface passed the DeviceNet Protocol Conformance
Test Software, version 2.0-1.00.  I make no claims beyond that.
You are welcome to use the source code as an education tool if
you find it useful.  Please do not use it directly in a
commercial product.
